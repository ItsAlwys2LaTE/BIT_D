          By joining our chapter, club members will gain exposure to the
          "what's" and "how's" of development. We concentrate on contributing to
          the overall development of individuals. Our aim is to create an
          environment that fosters collaboration and encourages learning,
          ultimately leading to the delivery of impactful results.

          <b>Developer Student Clubs (DSC)</b> are university-based community
          groups powered by Google Developers for students interested in
          Technology. These clubs help student developers learn through hands-on
          workshops. They then identify challenges faced by local businesses,
          NGOs, and sometimes even their own universities, and build real
          solutions for real problems.
