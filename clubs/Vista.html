      <h1><em>VISTA CLUB</em></h1>
      <div class="club-content">
        <p>
          A college is not all by itself; it stands on three crucial pillars,
          namely ACADEMICS, SPORTS, and Cultural activities. VISTA is BIT Durgâ€™s
          premier cultural club. It has earned remarkable recognition from the
          college in very short span. The VISTA club organizes various cultural
          events for the students from all batches and branches together.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club channels the immense creativity of students in our college
          and keeps them mentally stimulated while enjoying a well-deserved
          breathing space in between versatile technical sessions in the
          curriculum. It gives very good refreshing fragrances to both
          participants and volunteers that will certainly enhance confidence,
          personality, teamwork, and learning by experience. This will cater to
          the long-run personality development, essentially needed for an
          academic institution. Be it intra or inter-college competitions, VISTA
          has put talent on the map. VISTA identifies the immeasurable hidden
          talent that remains unacknowledged within the college by rectifying
          the indignity of the talented.
