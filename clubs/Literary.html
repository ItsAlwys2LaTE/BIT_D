          joining together into revamping ideas around the college for
          substantial purposes. As a team, we try to initiate conversations of
          varied literature facets of society. It is a place where readers,
          writers, designers, and artists around the college gather together to
          read, write and express themselves through their contribution to the
          making of the club.

          <p>
            The ‘Literary Club’ offers a friendly competing setting for students
            to learn, develop, and express their creative skills - where they
            can sharpen their creative, analytical, and comprehensive skills.
            The club strives to bridge the gap between students, faculty, and
            alumni as well. We aspire to provide an arena of interaction among
            fellow students via the Students Newsletter published from time to
            time.
